# Tom Fuertes

Fractional CTO at [NoTambourine](https://notambourine.com). Engineering leadership for PE portfolios and growth-stage companies - I embed with your team, push on what's stuck, and build the org to run without me.

**250+ companies. 10,000+ A/B tests. Still shipping code daily.**

## What I Do

I work 3-4 days/week inside your engineering org. Architecture, code review, sprint planning, hiring - whatever's blocking momentum. The goal is always the same: build the team so it runs without me.

Started in conversion rate optimization, grew a consultancy from 4 to 50 people, then ran product tech across 15 PE portfolio companies. Now I do this independently.

## Timeline

* **2004 - Freelance & Poker**:
Freelance web dev (Django, jQuery) while playing online poker professionally.
6-max / HU. Contract dev for HoldemManager. Transitioned to live for a while
after UIGEA.

* **2012 - Analytics Origins**:
Bazaarvoice → HomeAway. Migrated 30 web properties from Omniture to GA Premium,
saved $1.5m+ in platform renewals.

* **2013 - CRO Side Door**:
SeniorAdvisor.com and Cardinal Path. PageSpeed scores from 46→98 on mobile.
Maintained the "Google Analytics on Steroids" library. Deep in GTM, Ensighten,
and the weeds of tag management.

* **2014 - Clearhead**:
Director of Engineering at Clearhead, a digital optimization agency.
Built [gaab](https://github.com/tomfuertes/gaab), shipped Optimizely/GTM
integrations at scale. This is where A/B testing became infrastructure, not
just a marketing tool.

* **2015 - Cro Metrics**:
CTO. Data-driven experimentation consultancy. Grew the engineering org,
landed work at Uber, DoorDash, Casper, Patagonia, Adidas, Ring, Zendesk.
Four years of "help companies understand their customers through testing."

Board Member / CTO. Mobile conversion optimization - site speed, UX, cart flow.
Overlapped with the start of Digital Fuel.

* **2020 - Digital Fuel Capital**:
Head of Product Technology for a PE firm. 15 portfolio companies over ~5 years.
Embedded ahead of exit to fix engineering delivery. Diagnosed gaps, hired key
roles, reset delivery practices, drove execution through replatforms and
redesigns. Player-coach. The pattern: land, diagnose, hire, ship, make it
stick without you.

* **2021 - Web3 Detour**:
Fell down the crypto rabbit hole. Built an automated welcome nft on Loopring 
[welcometolayer2.com](https://welcometolayer2.com), Wrote an arb bot, NFT 
infrastructure. Learned Solidity, Rode it down, Lost it all, Touched grass, 
NGMI, moved on.

* **2024 - 8(NoTambourine)8**:
Went independent. Same playbook, own terms. Fractional CTO for PE portfolios
and growth-stage companies. 3-4 days/week embedded. Build the team, then leave.

* **2025 - Speedrunning ETH (Batch 23)**:
Came back to crypto through [Speedrun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
and [Batch 23](https://batch23.buidlguidl.com). Submitting transactions on
mainnet, [CTF challenges](https://ctf.buidlguidl.com/profile/0x882EC52E30cA90C3fcF6fC632d9a31061FAee789), 
hands-on Solidity. Less about shipping a product, more about finding joy in
the chain again.
