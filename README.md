# Tom Fuertes

Fractional CTO at [NoTambourine](https://notambourine.com). I embed with PE portfolios and growth-stage companies, push on what's stuck, and build the org to run without me.

**250+ companies. 10,000+ A/B tests. Still shipping code daily.**

## What I Do

I work 3-4 days/week inside your engineering org. Architecture, code review, sprint planning, hiring - whatever's blocking momentum. Build the team so it runs without me, then leave.

Started in conversion rate optimization, grew a consultancy from 4 to 50 people, then ran product tech across 15 PE portfolio companies. Now I do this independently.

## Timeline

* **2026 - Goose Farming**:
Gauntlet AI Fellow / Cohort 4.

* **2025 - Speedrunning ETH (Batch 23)**:
Came back to crypto through [Speedrun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
and [Batch 23](https://batch23.buidlguidl.com). Submitting transactions on
mainnet, [CTF challenges](https://ctf.buidlguidl.com/profile/0x882EC52E30cA90C3fcF6fC632d9a31061FAee789),
hands-on Solidity. Less about shipping a product, more about finding joy in
the chain again.

* **2024 - 8(NoTambourine)8**:
Went independent. Same playbook, own terms. Fractional CTO for PE portfolios
and growth-stage companies. 3-4 days/week embedded. Build the team, then leave.

Fell down the crypto rabbit hole. Built an automated welcome NFT on Loopring
[welcometolayer2.com](https://welcometolayer2.com), wrote an arb bot, NFT
infrastructure. Learned Solidity, Rode it down, Lost it all, Touched grass,
NGMI, moved on.

* **2020 - Digital Fuel Capital**:
Head of Product Technology for a PE firm. 15 portfolio companies over ~5 years.
Embedded ahead of exit to fix engineering delivery. Diagnosed gaps, hired key
roles, reset delivery practices, drove execution through replatforms and
redesigns. Player-coach. Show up, find the gap, hire into it, ship something, make sure it holds after I leave.

* **2019 - Mobile1st**:
Board Member / CTO. Mobile conversion optimization - site speed, UX, cart flow.
Overlapped with the start of Digital Fuel.

* **2015 - Cro Metrics**:
CTO. Experimentation consultancy. Grew the engineering org,
landed work at Uber, DoorDash, Casper, Patagonia, Adidas, Ring, Zendesk.
Four years of figuring out which tests actually changed behavior versus which just moved numbers.

* **2014 - Clearhead**:
Director of Engineering at Clearhead, a digital optimization agency.
Built [gaab](https://github.com/tomfuertes/gaab), shipped Optimizely/GTM
integrations at scale. This is where A/B testing became something the whole engineering team owned, not a marketing campaign.

* **2013 - CRO Side Door**:
SeniorAdvisor.com and Cardinal Path. PageSpeed scores from 46 to 98 on mobile.
Maintained the "Google Analytics on Steroids" library. Deep in GTM, Ensighten,
and the weeds of tag management.
