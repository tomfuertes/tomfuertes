# Tom Fuertes

Fractional CTO at [NoTambourine](https://notambourine.com). Engineering leadership for PE portfolios and growth-stage companies - I embed with your team, push on what's stuck, and build the org to run without me.

**250+ companies. 10,000+ A/B tests. Still shipping code daily.**

## What I Do

I work 3-4 days/week inside your engineering org. Architecture, code review, sprint planning, hiring - whatever's blocking momentum. The goal is always the same: build the team so it runs without me.

Started in conversion rate optimization, grew a consultancy from 4 to 50 people, then ran product tech across 15 PE portfolio companies. Now I do this independently.
