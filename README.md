# Tom Fuertes

Fractional CTO at [NoTambourine](https://notambourine.com). Engineering leadership for PE portfolios and growth-stage companies - I embed with your team, push on what's stuck, and build the org to run without me.

**250+ companies. 10,000+ A/B tests. Still shipping code daily.**

## What I Do

I work 3-4 days/week inside your engineering org. Architecture, code review, sprint planning, hiring - whatever's blocking momentum. The goal is always the same: build the team so it runs without me.

Started in conversion rate optimization, grew a consultancy from 4 to 50 people, then ran product tech across 15 PE portfolio companies. Now I do this independently.

## Timeline

**2004 - Freelance & Poker**
Freelance web dev (Django, jQuery) while playing online poker professionally. 
6-12 NLHE tables, HUD stats, volume as edge. Live for a while after UIGEA.

**2012 - Analytics Origins**
Bazaarvoice → HomeAway. Migrated 30 web properties from Omniture to GA Premium,
saved $500K+ in platform renewals. Found out I liked the measurement side more
than the building side. That changed.

**2013 - CRO Side Door**
SeniorAdvisor.com and Cardinal Path. PageSpeed scores from 46→98 on mobile.
Built the "Google Analytics on Steroids" library. Deep in GTM, Ensighten,
and the weeds of tag management.

**2014 - Clearhead**
Director of Engineering at Clearhead, a digital optimization agency.
Built [gaab](https://github.com/tomfuertes/gaab), shipped Optimizely/GTM
integrations at scale. This is where A/B testing became infrastructure, not
just a marketing tool.

**2015 - Cro Metrics**
CTO. Data-driven experimentation consultancy. Grew the engineering org,
landed work at Uber, DoorDash, Casper, Patagonia, Adidas, Ring, Zendesk.
Four years of "help companies understand their customers through testing."

**2019 - Mobile1st**
Board Member / CTO. Mobile conversion optimization - site speed, UX, cart flow.
Overlapped with the start of Digital Fuel.

**2020 - Digital Fuel Capital**
Head of Product Technology for a PE firm. 15 portfolio companies over ~5 years.
Embedded ahead of exit to fix engineering delivery. Diagnosed gaps, hired key
roles, reset delivery practices, drove execution through replatforms and
redesigns. Player-coach. The pattern: land, diagnose, hire, ship, make it
stick without you.

**2021 - Web3 Detour**
Fell down the crypto rabbit hole. Built an automated welcome nft on Loopring 
[welcometolayer2.com](https://welcometolayer2.com), Wrote an arb bot, NFT 
infrastructure. Learned Solidity, Rode it down, Lost it all, Touched grass, 
NGMI, moved on.

**2024 - NoTambourine**
Went independent. Same playbook, own terms. Fractional CTO for PE portfolios
and growth-stage companies. 3-4 days/week embedded. Build the team, then leave.
